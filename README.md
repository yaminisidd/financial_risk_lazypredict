Implemented Lazy Predict classifier for prediction of financial Risk Analysis
Financial Risk Prediction using Lazy Predict
This repository provides an implementation of financial risk prediction using the Lazy Predict library in Python. Lazy Predict is a machine learning library that automates the model selection and evaluation process, making it easy to quickly test multiple algorithms on a given dataset.

The goal of this project is to predict financial risk for a given dataset using various machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance. By using Lazy Predict, we can save time by automatically trying out multiple models without the need for extensive coding.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place your financial risk dataset in the project directory.
Open the predict_financial_risk.py script in a text editor.
Modify the script to load your dataset and specify the target variable and features according to your dataset structure.
Save the changes to the script.
In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to execute the script:
shell
Copy code
python predict_financial_risk.py
The script will automatically generate predictions for various machine learning models using Lazy Predict.
The performance metrics for each model will be displayed in the console.
Note: You can modify the script to customize the behavior of Lazy Predict, such as including or excluding specific models, specifying evaluation metrics, or configuring cross-validation.
